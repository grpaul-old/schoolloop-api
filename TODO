- the time that the session is open is realllly short. i think we need
  to check whether we've been logged out or not in each api method, and
  store the username and password so we can re-login if we do get logged
  out
  - Should that detection go in page()? kinda hacky but meh
- ASK SCHOOLLOOP TO MAKE AN API (AND VISIT THEM AT THEIR OFFICES :P)
  - So they do have an API. But we need to ask them for a public-facing
    one and for Lowell to enable it.
